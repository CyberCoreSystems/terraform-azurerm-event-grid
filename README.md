# Event Grid Topic & Subscriptions

An Event Grid custom topic plus event subscriptions with an optional in-module Storage Queue target - SAS auth off (Entra ID), a system-assigned identity, and HTTPS-only TLS 1.2+ storage.

This module was **applied to a real Azure account, verified, and destroyed** on 2026-06-30 - not just `terraform validate`d.

Check it yourself, no account needed:

```
curl -s https://www.iac-bazaar.com/api/artifacts/azure-event-grid/verification
```

The receipt names every check that ran, when it ran, and the SHA-256 of the
archive it describes. Full detail: [www.iac-bazaar.com/catalog/azure-event-grid](https://www.iac-bazaar.com/catalog/azure-event-grid)

## Usage

```hcl
module "event_grid" {
  source  = "registry.terraform.io/CyberCoreSystems/event-grid/azurerm"
  version = "~> 1.0"

  # See variables.tf for the full input contract.
}
```

## Why this module

Every module we publish goes through the same checks before release:

| check | what it means |
|---|---|
| `tofu validate` + `tflint` | it parses and lints clean |
| `checkov` | scanned for insecure defaults |
| **live test** | **really applied to a cloud account, outputs verified, then destroyed** |

That last row is the one most module catalogues skip. A module that has never
been applied has never been proven.

## Provider compatibility

```
azurerm >= 4.0, < 5.0
```
